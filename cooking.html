          Cooking, for me, is more than just making food — it’s a form of
          self-expression and mindfulness. When I cook, time slows down. Every
          sound, every aroma, every small motion connects me with the present.
          Whether it’s experimenting with flavors or recreating family recipes,
          I find comfort and creativity in the kitchen.
